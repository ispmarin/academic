Working notes for Groundwater, DNAPL and contamination simulation.

DNAPL
-----
This directory stores my notes on multiphasic, density dependent flow of contaminants. It includes Darcy's Law generalization for multiphasic flows, advection, dispersion and diffusion mechanisms, and a small glossary of the most commom used terms. Mostly of these notes are being written in Université Laval, Québec, Canada.
