  abstract = {An analysis of aerobic m-xylene biodegradation kinetics was performed
	on the results of laboratory batch microcosms. A modified version
	of the computer model {BIO3D} was used to determine the Monod kinetic
	parameters, kmax (maximum utilization rate) and {KS} (half-utilization
	constant), as well as the Haldane inhibition concentration, {KI},
	for pristine Borden aquifer material. The proposed method allows
	for substrate degradation under microbial growth conditions. The
	problem of non-uniqueness of the calculated parameters was overcome
	by using several different initial substrate concentrations. With
	a relative-least-squares technique, unique kinetic degradation parameters
	were obtained. Calculation of the microbial yield, Y, based on microbial
	counts from the beginning and the end of the experiments was crucial
	for reducing the number of unknowns in the system and therefore for
	the accurate determination of the kinetic degradation parameters.
	The kinetic parameters obtained in the present study were found to
	agree well with values reported in the literature.},

  title = {Biodegradation modelling of a dissolved gasoline plume applying independent
	laboratory and field parameters},
  journal = {Journal of Contaminant Hydrology},
  year = {2000},
  volume = {46},
  pages = {339--374},
  number = {3â€“4},
  abstract = {Biodegradation of organic contaminants in groundwater is a microscale
	process which is often observed on scales of 100s of metres or larger.
	Unfortunately, there are no known equivalent parameters for characterizing
	the biodegradation process at the macroscale as there are, for example,
	in the case of hydrodynamic dispersion. Zero- and first-order degradation
	rates estimated at the laboratory scale by model fitting generally
	overpredict the rate of biodegradation when applied to the field
	scale because limited electron acceptor availability and microbial
	growth are not considered. On the other hand, field-estimated zero-
	and first-order rates are often not suitable for predicting plume
	development because they may oversimplify or neglect several key
	field scale processes, phenomena and characteristics. This study
	uses the numerical model {BIO3D} to link the laboratory and field
	scales by applying laboratory-derived Monod kinetic degradation parameters
	to simulate a dissolved gasoline field experiment at the Canadian
	Forces Base ({CFB)} Borden. All input parameters were derived from
	independent laboratory and field measurements or taken from the literature
	a priori to the simulations. The simulated results match the experimental
	results reasonably well without model calibration. A sensitivity
	analysis on the most uncertain input parameters showed only a minor
	influence on the simulation results. Furthermore, it is shown that
	the flow field, the amount of electron acceptor (oxygen) available,
	and the Monod kinetic parameters have a significant influence on
	the simulated results. It is concluded that laboratory-derived Monod
	kinetic parameters can adequately describe field scale degradation,
	provided all controlling factors are incorporated in the field scale
	model. These factors include advectiveâ€“dispersive transport of
	multiple contaminants and electron acceptors and large-scale spatial
	heterogeneities.},
