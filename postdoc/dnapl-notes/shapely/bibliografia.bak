	{OpenGIS} and {ISO} Standard that specifies a common storage model
	of geographical data (point, line, polygon, multi-point, multi-line,
	etc.) using well-known text (or binary). The geometries are also
	associated with spatial reference systems. The {SFA} also specifies
	attributes, methods and assertions with the geometries.},

  abstract = {Well-known text {(WKT)} is a text markup language for representing
	vector geometry objects on a map, spatial reference systems of spatial
	objects and transformations between spatial reference systems. A
	binary equivalent, known as well-known binary {(WKB)} is used to
	transfer and store the same information on databases, such as {PostGIS}
	and {DB2.} The formats were originally defined by the Open Geospatial
	Consortium {(OGC)} and described in their Simple Feature Access and
	Coordinate Transformation Service specifications. The current standard
	definition is in the {ISO/IEC} 13249-3:2011 standard, {"Information}
	technology -- Database languages -- {SQL} multimedia and application
	packages -- Part 3: Spatial".},
