	to locate geographical entities. A spatial reference system defines
	a specific map projection, as well as transformations between different
	spatial reference systems. Spatial reference systems are defined
	by the {OGC's} Simple feature access using well-known text, and support
	has been implemented by several standards-based geographic information
	systems. Spatial reference systems can be referred to using a {SRID}
	integer, including {EPSG} codes defined by the International Association
