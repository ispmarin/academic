This is the integration of Phreeqc and Fortran via the library IPhreeqc. 

## Project description

The idea of this interface is to connect a Fortran code that cand o transport, for example, with a Phreeqc geochemistry simulation. The Fortran application should pass an array for the concentrations of the chemical elements. 

We use the IPhreeqc library for the interface with Phreeqc. More instructions can be found at the documentation.
